# Supabase Migration Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps troubleshoot and fix common issues with Supabase migrations, including pgcrypto extension problems and UUID to TEXT conversion issues.

## Common Issues

### "Failed to execute: CREATE EXTENSION pgcrypto" Error

This error occurs when the GitHub workflow or Supabase CLI tries to create the pgcrypto extension but the database user doesn't have sufficient privileges:

```
Executing: Created extension pgcrypto
Trying direct SQL execution for: Created extension pgcrypto
‚ùå Failed to execute: Created extension pgcrypto
Manual SQL command (for reference):
------------------------------------
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;
------------------------------------
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

This happens because:
1. The database user doesn't have superuser privileges required to create extensions
2. The extension may be installed in a different schema
3. PostgreSQL version might not support the extension

### "Failed to run migration: ALTER TABLE failed" Error

This error typically occurs when trying to alter column types, particularly when converting UUID columns to TEXT. The error might look like:

```
Error: Failed to run migration: ALTER TABLE "profiles" ALTER COLUMN "id" TYPE text;
```

This happens because:
1. There are foreign key constraints referencing the column
2. The migration attempts to change the type directly without handling the constraints

## Helper Scripts

We've created several helper scripts to diagnose and fix these issues:

### 1. Ensure pgcrypto Extension

This script safely handles pgcrypto extension creation, even without superuser privileges:

```bash
./scripts/db/ensure_pgcrypto.sh "your_db_password" "your_project_id"
```

It will:
- Check if the pgcrypto extension already exists
- Try to create it if it doesn't, with proper error handling
- Continue even if it fails (with appropriate warnings)
- Verify that essential functions like `gen_random_uuid()` are available

### 2. Diagnose Migrations

This script checks the current state of your database schema and migrations:

```bash
./scripts/db/diagnose_migrations.sh "postgresql://postgres:your_password@localhost:54322/postgres"
```

It will:
- Check if tables mentioned in migrations exist
- Show column types for ID columns
- List foreign key constraints
- Display the status of applied migrations

### 2. Fresh Link and Push

This script creates a clean setup for linking and pushing to a Supabase project:

```bash
./scripts/db/fresh_link_and_push.sh "your-project-ref" "your-db-password"
```

It will:
- Create fresh temp directories
- Run a full Supabase link command
- Check and clean the project-ref file
- Create and push a test migration
- Attempt to push the main migrations in dry-run mode

### 3. Fix UUID to TEXT Conversion

This script safely converts UUID columns to TEXT type:

```bash
./scripts/db/fix_uuid_to_text.sh "postgresql://postgres:your_password@localhost:54322/postgres"
```

It will:
- Check each relevant table and column
- Safely convert UUID columns to TEXT by:
  - Creating a temporary TEXT column
  - Copying the UUID values as TEXT
  - Dropping the original column
  - Renaming the temporary column to the original name

## Step-by-Step Resolution Process

### For pgcrypto Extension Issues:

1. **Use our safe pgcrypto script**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/db/ensure_pgcrypto.sh "your-db-password" "your-project-id"
   ```

2. **Update the workflow**:
   Ensure the prod-deploy.yml workflow calls the ensure_pgcrypto.sh script before attempting other database operations.

3. **Check if the extension is available in the database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pgcrypto';
   ```

### For UUID to TEXT Conversion Issues:

1. **Diagnose the issue**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/db/diagnose_migrations.sh "your-connection-string"
   ```

2. **Fix UUID columns manually**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/db/fix_uuid_to_text.sh "your-connection-string"
   ```

3. **Retry the migration**:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

4. If issues persist with project linking:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/db/fresh_link_and_push.sh "your-project-ref" "your-db-password"
   ```

## Additional Tips

- Always create a database backup before running migrations
- Consider adding `IF EXISTS` clauses to your migration SQL
- For complex schema changes, consider breaking them into multiple migrations
- Test migrations against a copy of your production database before applying them to production
