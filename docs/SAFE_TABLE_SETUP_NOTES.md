# Additional Migration Notes for safe_table_setup.sh

This document provides additional information about the updated `safe_table_setup.sh` script.

## Using Supabase CLI instead of direct psql

The `safe_table_setup.sh` script has been updated to use the Supabase CLI rather than direct psql connections. This change was made for the following reasons:

1. **Network Issues**: Direct psql connections were failing in GitHub Actions with "Network is unreachable" errors
2. **Authentication**: The Supabase CLI handles authentication more consistently
3. **Consistency**: Using the CLI provides a consistent interface for all database operations

## Key Changes

The script now:

1. Uses `supabase db push` for applying migrations rather than direct psql execution
2. Uses `supabase db execute` for checking table existence
3. Creates temporary migration files for each operation instead of direct SQL execution
4. Provides better error handling and diagnostic information

## Example Error Fixed

```
Continuing despite error (as requested)
psql: error: connection to server at "db.tfvzdjaebqirmowvgowz.supabase.co" (2600:1f18:2e13:9d09:5966:41a:ccc1:d646), port 5432 failed: Network is unreachable
	Is the server running on that host and accepting TCP/IP connections?
```

By using the Supabase CLI, which establishes connections through its own channels, we avoid direct network connectivity issues that psql might encounter in certain environments like GitHub Actions.

## Usage

No changes to the usage pattern - the script is still called the same way:

```bash
./scripts/db/safe_table_setup.sh "<PROJECT_ID>" "<ACCESS_TOKEN>" "<DB_PASSWORD>"
```

## Further Improvements

We could further enhance this script by:

1. Adding more robust logging
2. Adding a way to specify specific tables to check/create
3. Adding a rollback mechanism for failed migrations
